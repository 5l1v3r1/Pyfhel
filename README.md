# Pyfhel v1

* **_Description_**: Homomorphic Encryption Library for Python. Allows ADDITION, SUBSTRACTION, MULTIPLICATION, SCALAR PRODUCT and binary operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, SHIFT & ROTATE) over encrypted vectors of integers/binaries. EXTRA: Documentation and Tests for Helib, as well as a Makefile to turn Helib into a shared library.
* **_Language_**: Python2.7 on top of C++ (with Cython).
* **_Dependencies_**: [HElib](https://github.com/shaih/HElib), [GMP](http://www.gmplib.org), [NTL](http://www.shoup.net/ntl/download.html)
* **_License_**: [GNU GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)

## Summary
**PY**thon **F**or **H**momorphic **E**ncryption **L**ibraries, **Pyfhel** implements some basic functionalities of HElib as a Homomorphic Encryption library such as sum, mult, or scalar product in Python (currently only for Python2.7). **Pyfhel** allows the use of HElib inside Python and with a syntax similar to normal arithmetics (+,-,\*). This library is useful both for simple Homomorphic Encryption Demos as well as for complex problems such as implementing Machine Learning algorithms.

**Pyfhel** is built on top of **Afhel**, an **A**bstraction **H**momorphic **E**ncryption **L**ibraries in C++. **Afhel** uses an unordered Map to manage HElib Cyphertexts using key-value storage with keys of type _String_. It implements the most important the HElib operations using only the keys for its functions, adding some extra functionalities not present in HElib such as Scalar Product.

Additionally, this project contains a large series of Demos & Tests for **HElib**, **Afhel** & **Pyfhel**.

Last but not least, we include a Makefile to compile and install **HElib** as a shared library, which can then be linked to other C++ programs using the tag `-fhe`.

## Installation
Follow the instructions in *INSTALL.md* for the complete installation process. 

## Update, Clean & Uninstall
   Update by running in the src/ directory:
       
       > sudo make upgrade

   Installation process creates several files that are no longer needed. If you want to erase them, as well as any executable created inside this project (files ending by _\_x_) and any environment files (.aenv, these are very big):
       
       > sudo make clean

   Uninstalling all components at once is performed by running:
       
       > sudo make uninstall
       
If you want to uninstall any particular component, navigate to HElib/src/, Afhel/ or Pyfhel/ directories and run that same command.
   
## Project contents
- `src/` contains the source code for Pyfhel, Afhel and HElib.

- `docs/` includes all documentation of the project:

     - *Doc.md*: Essential documentation of the project. A recommended reading material.
     - *Doc_API.md*: Comprehensive list of all classes & methods available in Pyfhel.
     - `Helib/`: docs and images explaining this otherwise undocumented library.

- `src/Demos_Tests`, a collection of Demos and Tests for all three libraries
- `src/.Makefiles/Makefile_HElib`, a makefile to compile and install HElib as a dynamic library (`-fhe`).
