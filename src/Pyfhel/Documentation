| **class NeuralNetwork** |               |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **variables**           |               |
| layers                  | an array containing all the Layers the network is made of |
| **functions**           |               |
| _ init _                | it initializes the `layers` variable |
| predict                 | for the given input `X` it computes the predicted label, going through all the layers. |
| error                   | it receives as input two arrays: the testing data and the testing labels, then it performs the prediction for each element of the testing data and, comparing the result with the resting label, returns the ratio or uncorrect predictions |
